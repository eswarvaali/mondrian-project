# Mondrian Project
Mondrian projects typically refer to creative works, often in the realm of design, art, or coding, inspired by the geometric style of the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian. Mondrian was a pioneer of abstract art and is best known for his De Stijl movement, which emphasized simplicity and harmony through geometric shapes and a limited color palette, primarily consisting of primary colors (red, blue, yellow) along with black and white.
